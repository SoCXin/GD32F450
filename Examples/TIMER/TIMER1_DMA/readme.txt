  @brief
    This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to
  use DMA with TIMER1 Update request to transfer Data from memory to TIMER1 
  capture compare register 1.
  
    TIMER1CLK is fixed to SystemCoreClock, the TIMER1 Prescaler is equal to 72
  so the TIMER1 counter clock used is 1MHz.

    The objective is to configure TIMER1 channel 1(PA8) to generate PWM signal with
  a frequency equal to 1KHz and a variable duty cycle(25%,50%,75%) that is changed
  by the DMA after a specific number of Update DMA request.

    The number of this repetitive requests is defined by the TIMER1 Repetition counter,
  each 2 Update Requests, the TIMER1 Channel 1 Duty Cycle changes to the next new 
  value defined by the buffer .
