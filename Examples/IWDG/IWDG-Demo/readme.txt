  @brief
    This demo is based on the GD32150R-EVAL/GD32190R-EVAL board, it shows how to 
  reload at regulate period the IWDG counter using the EXTI interrupt. The IWDG 
  timeout is set to 1s (the timeout may varies due to LSI frequency dispersion).
    An EXTI is connected to a specific GPIO pin and configured to generate an interrupt
  on its falling edge: when the EXTI Line interrupt is triggered (by pressing the Key 
  push-button on the board), the corresponding interrupt is served. In the ISR, IWDG 
  counter is reloaded). As a result, when the IWDG counter is reloaded, which prevents 
  any IWDG reset, LED1 remain illuminated.   
    If the EXTI Line interrupt does not occur, the IWDG counter is not reloaded before
  the IWDG counter reaches 00h, and the IWDG reset. If the IWDG reset is generated, LED1 
  is turned off with the system reset.
    In this example the system clock is set to 72 MHz.
